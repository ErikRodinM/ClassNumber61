        <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is
            an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language,
            the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a
            professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

            Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year
            Honours "for services to the global development of the Internet", and was invested formally on 16 July 2004.

            Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was
            available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web
            was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with your own
            website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for
            collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.
